To normalize, Amplitude finds the difference the loudest reading it has processed and the maximum amplitude of 1.0. Amplitude adds this difference to all values to produce results that will reliably map between 0.0 and 1.0. However, if a louder moment occurs, the amount that Normalize adds to all the values will change. Accepts an optional boolean parameter (true or false). Normalizing is off by default.",
