		"description": "Scale the output of all sound in this sketch Scaled between 0.0 (silence) and 1.0 (full volume). 1.0 is the maximum amplitude of a digital sound, so multiplying by greater than 1.0 may cause digital distortion. To fade, provide a rampTime parameter. For more complex fades, see the Env class.  Alternately, you can pass in a signal source such as an oscillator to modulate the amplitude with an audio signal.  How This Works: When you load the p5.sound module, it creates a single instance of p5sound. All sound objects in this module output to p5sound before reaching your computer's output. So if you change the amplitude of p5sound, it impacts all of the sound in this module.  If no value is provided, returns a Web Audio API Gain Node",
